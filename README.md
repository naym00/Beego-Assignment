```
sha256sum go1.16.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

#### step 4
- [x] Next, use `tar` to extract the tarball. This command includes the `-C` flag which instructs tar to change to the given directory before performing any other operations

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/home/yourpcname/go/bin
export GOPATH="/home/yourpcname/go/"
export GOBIN="/home/yourpcname/go/bin"
```

- [x] After youâ€™ve added this information to your profile, save and close the file. If you used nano, do so by pressing CTRL+X, then Y, and then ENTER.
